Recipe Page Project
This is my first project doing this course and I am applying what I learned with HTML to make this webpage for Recipes. I think that a recipe page is a good starting point to learn cause it takes alot of things like making lists, using images and setting up multiple pages and linking everything together to make a functional webpage. I know that it will not look the best yet because I have no CSS practice yet. But I am excited to try this out and make something with what I have larned so far. I will be coming back at the end of the project to tell what I have learned through this process and see what I can do better.
